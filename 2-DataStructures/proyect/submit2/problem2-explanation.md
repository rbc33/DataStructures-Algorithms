# LRU Cache Implementation

This implementation of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache efficiently manages a fixed-size cache by removing the least recently accessed items when the cache reaches capacity.

The solution uses a combination of:

- A dictionary ( self.cache ) for O(1) key-value lookups
- A double-ended queue ( collections.deque ) for tracking access order
  When an item is accessed or updated, it's moved to the front of the queue, marking it as most recently used. When the cache reaches capacity and a new item needs to be added, the least recently used item (at the end of the queue) is removed.

The time complexity for both get and set operations is O(1), with space complexity of O(n) where n is the cache capacity. Using Python's built-in deque provides efficient operations at both ends of the queue without the need to implement a custom doubly linked list.

This implementation handles edge cases such as zero capacity caches and maintains proper LRU ordering when items are accessed or updated.

# File Finding Recursion Implementation

This implementation recursively searches through a directory structure to find all files with a specified suffix. The solution employs a depth-first search approach to traverse the file system hierarchy.

Key features of this implementation:

- Uses Python's built-in os module for file system operations
- Handles nested directories of arbitrary depth
- Efficiently collects matching files using recursion
  The function works by:

1. Checking if the path exists (base case for invalid paths)
2. Listing all entries in the current directory
3. For each entry:
   - If it's a file with the matching suffix, add it to the result list
   - If it's a directory, recursively search within it
     The time complexity is O(n) where n is the total number of files and directories under the given path. Space complexity is O(m) where m is the number of matching files plus the maximum recursion depth.

Note: There's an unreachable return None statement at the end of the function that could be removed for cleaner code.
