# Linked List Union and Intersection Operations

This implementation provides solutions for finding the union and intersection of two linked lists, which are fundamental set operations applied to linked data structures.

The solution uses:

- A `Node` class to represent individual elements in the linked list
- A `LinkedList` class that maintains a chain of nodes with standard operations
- Two specialized functions for set operations: union and intersection

The algorithm works by:

1. For union: Appending the second list to the end of the first list
2. For intersection: Comparing each element of the first list with every element of the second list

The time complexity for union is O(n) where n is the length of the first list, as we need to traverse to the end. The time complexity for intersection is O(n\*m) where n and m are the lengths of the two lists, as we need to compare each element of the first list with every element of the second list.

The space complexity for union is O(1) as we're modifying the existing lists, while for intersection it's O(k) where k is the number of common elements.

This implementation could be improved by handling duplicates and empty lists more efficiently, and by using a hash table for the intersection operation to reduce time complexity to O(n+m).
