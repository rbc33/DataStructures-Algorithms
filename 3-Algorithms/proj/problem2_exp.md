The implementation uses binary search with modified indexes to efficiently find the target number.

Time Complexity: O(log n) - The binary search algorithm divides the search space in half with each iteration, resulting in logarithmic time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(1) - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
