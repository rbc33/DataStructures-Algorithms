This implementation uses a Trie data structure to create an HTTP router that efficiently maps URL paths to handlers. It achieves O(n) time complexity for both adding routes and looking up paths, where n is the number of path segments. The space complexity is O(n\*m) where n is the number of routes and m is the average number of path segments per route. The implementation handles edge cases like trailing slashes and root paths by properly splitting the URL paths into segments.
