This implementation uses a Trie data structure to efficiently store and retrieve words with common prefixes. It achieves O(n) time complexity for insertion and search operations, where n is the length of the word or prefix. The autocomplete functionality (suffixes) has O(m) time complexity, where m is the total number of characters in all matching words. The space complexity is O(n\*m) where n is the average word length and m is the number of words, as each character requires a node in the trie.
